Version 20191229 alpha 3

The zip package is just for the checksums and contains all the project files.

Required: 
base module: Python3, Pyqt5, PyXdg, xdg-utils
optional media module: python3-dbus.

Just launch the file qmfm.py from the project directory to open the home folder,
or open a different folder from the command line or by chancing the config file.

------------

The optional disks and trash modules do not track any changes while their tabs are open.

The disks tab let user manage the recycle bin of every partition, if supported.
This means the home recycle bin is indipendent from the recycle bin of the other
storage masses.

The program support custom scripts and custom thumbnailers.
Thumbnailers for images, videos (using ffmpegthumbnailer), and pdf files 
(using pdftocairo) are provided.
At the moment, the following script are provided: open xterm in the current directory (if
xterm is installed); calculate the checksum of the selected items (if the checksums
are installed); extract the content of the selected archive, alse with password 
(if 7z is installed); create a tar or tar.gz archive (if tar and gzip are installed).

Drag and Drop is supported.

The program also support the default templates directory, or a generic Templates
folder.

At the moment the hidden features are:
- CTRL+s : the window size is saved; in fullscreen mode only this state is saved.
- The program accept a folder or file path as argument.
- When html/htm files are copied or dropped into this program the associated 
folders will be copied too, and viceversa.
- Recycle bin tabs: the files have a contextual menu; folders can be opened in a
new tab, and files opened with the default program, if any, with a double click.
- Progress dialog during copying operations: the current copying operation cannot be
interrupted, only the following ones can be interrupted.
- Delete key: selected items into recycle bin.

What is not implemented and maybe never will be implemented:
- the XDS protocol, due to lack of documentation.
