------------

I've made this program because in some circumstances I need a different file
manager. It has very poor features, the ones I use to use everyday, plus others 
I need.

The disks and trash modules do not track any changes while their tabs are open.
I do not have much time for such things.

The disks tab let user manage the recycle bin of every partition, if supported.
This means the home recycle bin is indipendent from the recycle bin of the other
storage masses.

The program support custom scripts and custom thumbnailers. Thumbnailers for images,
videos, using ffmpegthumbnailer, and pdf files (using pdftocairo) are provided.

The program also support the default templates directory, or a generic Templates
folder.

At the moment the hidden features are:
- CTRL+s : the window size is saved; in fullscreen mode only this state is saved.
- The program accept a folder or file path as argument.
- When html/htm files are copied or dropped into this program the associated 
folders will be copied too, and viceversa.
- Recycle bin tabs: the files have a contextual menu; folders can be opened in a
new tab, and files opened with the default program, if any, with a double click.
- Progress dialog during copying operations: the current copying operation cannot be
interrupted, only the following ones can be interrupted.

What is not implemented and maybe never will be implemented:
- the XDS protocol, due to lack of documentation.
