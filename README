------------

I've made this program because in some circumstances I need a different file
manager. It has very poor features, the ones I use to use everyday, plus others 
I need.

The disks and trash modules do not track any changes while their tabs are open.
I do not have much time for such things.

The disks tab let user manage the recycle bin of every partition, if supported.
This means the home recycle bin is indipendent from the recycle bin of the other
storage masses.

At the moment the hidden features are:
- CTRL+s : the window size is saved; in fullscreen mode only this state is saved.
- The program accept a folder or file path as argument.
- When some html/htm files are copied or dropped into this program the associated 
folders will be copied too, and viceversa.
