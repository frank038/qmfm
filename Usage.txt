The behaviours of this program depend on the library defaults mostly.

Multi selection:
- to date, the SHIFT key is been used for a row or multi row
selection;
- the first item selected is the master item; this means dragging 
using the mouse must start from that item;

Dragging:
- the defaul action is copying;
- to date, the SHIFT key must be pressed for moving action: first 
select the items; then release the mouse buttons and then SHIFT+LEFT MOUSE BUTTON;
- to date, SHIFT+CTRL+LMB make a link at destination;

CTRL+s : the window size is saved; in fullscreen mode only this state is saved.

Delete (canc) key: selected items into the recycle bin if choosen so in the config file.
